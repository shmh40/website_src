Where is it appropriate to deploy causal inference
<!--more-->

If we deploy causal discovery techniques on models, we hope to uncover the causal relationships found in the models. The question is why use causal inference on the model at all? We know all the equations, and we can perturb things. We can essentially carry out experiments, by perturbing equations or conditions. So why should we use causal discovery algorithms? Because things are so coupled and so it is hard to understand the effects of perturbation? I don't think that is a good answer.

Surely it only makes sense to do causal discovery on observational data? Or reanalysis data? It is certainly a question of tooling.

I suppose we can do causal discovery on a number of models to determine their causal networks and then compare them?

Also does causal inference deal well in scenarios where there is a step change in a relationship...because of science? i.e. at a certain temperature we see a different relationship starting to occur...?

So why has this been agreed as a project?
