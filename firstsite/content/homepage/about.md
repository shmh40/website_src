## Introduction

I'm Sebastian (Seb) Hickman, a PhD student at the University of Cambridge, supervised by [Alex Archibald](https://www.ch.cam.ac.uk/person/ata27), [Paul Griffiths](https://www.ch.cam.ac.uk/person/ptg21) and [Peer Nowack](https://research-portal.uea.ac.uk/en/persons/peer-nowack). I am funded by the [AI4ER CDT](https://ai4er-cdt.esc.cam.ac.uk/). 

This summer I was an intern with [David Rolnick](https://mila.quebec/en/directory/david-rolnick) at Mila, where I worked on learning causal representations of climate model data with deep probabilistic models. Last summer I worked with [Martin Schultz](https://www.fz-juelich.de/profile/schultz_m) on MLAir and AtmoRep.

My PhD looks at modelling ozone and climate with machine learning and causal models. Previously, I read Natural Sciences at Cambridge, graduating in 2020.

Please do contact [me](mailto:shmh4@cam.ac.uk) if you would like to talk.

I may keep a list of interesting content. This always makes me chuckle on other people's websites - why do people want to share the random things *they* think are interesting?

Actually that sounds [fun](https://shmh40.github.io/sui-generis/).
