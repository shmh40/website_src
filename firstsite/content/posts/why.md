Why work in environmental science? And why use machine learning?

## Why environmental science? Why machine learning?

This need not be an apology...

These are two key questions I need to answer to justify my current work. The first is easier than the second.

The world is certainly warming. This will likely lead to negative impacts on living species. Possible negative impacts include extinction, displacement and increased mortality. The damage to the natural world is terrible by itself, but my main justification comes from the effect of climate change on humans.What eats at me, and lets me justify my work, is that while developed countries seem likely to manage 2 degrees of warming relatively unscathed (measures to mitigate natural hazards, education and relocation of the population), developing countries are unlikely to fare so well. And what is biting about this situation is that the developed countries have caused the vast majority of climate change. Developing countries, later to industrialise, have contributed relatively little.

This is my justification for working in the loose field of environmental action. However my area of work is environmental science, specifically using data and machine learning to better **understand** the natural world.

At best, over the course of my research, I will have published work that advances our grasp on environmental processes, and may perhaps increase understanding of the drivers of environmental change. I will have done nothing to prevent the change. This means that there is considerable weight on the communication of my work to policy-makers, who are then persuaded to act on this new information. This process is likely to take years, at best. Does this pursuit hold up under the time pressure of climate change? Surely the best course of action for maximum impact would be to become an activist, or a scientific advisor to policy makers? Or perhaps to skip them entirely, and create products and services that cut emissions and protect people from the effects of climate change?

Machine learning?

Machine learning refers to a collection of statistical methods to extract relationships between variables in datasets, that can be automated by a computer.
