## Introduction

Yet another blog.

Posts will likely be about machine learning, causality, and their applications to environmental research. Areas of environmental research of particular interest include flooding, (de)forestation and examining climate models.

These posts will hopefully improve my writing.

***

I may also keep a list of interesting content. This always makes me chuckle on other people's websites - why on earth do people want to share the things they think are interesting but unimportant?

Actually that sounds fun.

## More

Posting on:

- Causal inference and discovery in high dimensional systems.
- Machine learning, with an eye on uncertainty.

Wary of:

- Being verbose.
- Asserting strong opinions.
- Out of sample performance.
