### Prediction without understanding is, at best, unsatisfying

I occassionally think about [Deep Thought](https://hitchhikers.fandom.com/wiki/Deep_Thought), the supercomputer designed by the mousey hyper-intelligent beings of Douglas Adams' [The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hitchhiker%27s_Guide_to_the_Galaxy).

Deep Thought was programmed to answer the Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe and Everything. It did a good job, spitting out the correct answer, 42.

What did this achieve for the hyper-intelligent mice?

Well, they learned the answer to the Question. They also learned that they needed to better define the Question.

Similarly, is prediction without understanding a sensible thing for us to seek?

Perhaps, in certain circumstances...

However imagine a fresh scenario. We have replaced GPs with AI's that can diagnose the patient's problem.

But this AI, without an understanding causal inference and counterfactuals, would be unable to tell the patient what to do to avoid having the problem again.

And surely it is that step that is the essential one. It is the one where more complete knowledge is passed on. And surely it is that kind of system we should be seeking. And the purely predictive systems, which rely on correlations, cannot answer such questions.

In [The Bitter Lesson](http://incompleteideas.net/IncIdeas/BitterLesson.html), Rich Sutton suggests that the most 'effective' algorithms 'by a large margin' are those that can scale with compute (relying on search and learning, like large, flexible NNs, and RL). In fairness, he is arguing a slightly separate point to the one I am making. But I simply want to suggest that he ought to take care with his definition of effective. Are these the best predictive algorithms, or the ones that offer us the most understanding of the system in hand?
