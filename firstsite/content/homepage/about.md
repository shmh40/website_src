## Introduction

I am Sebastian Hickman, a first year PhD student at the University of Cambridge, supervised by [Alex Archibald](https://www.ch.cam.ac.uk/person/ata27), [Paul Griffiths](https://www.ch.cam.ac.uk/person/ptg21) and [Peer Nowack](https://research-portal.uea.ac.uk/en/persons/peer-nowack). I am funded by the [AI4ER CDT](https://ai4er-cdt.esc.cam.ac.uk/).

I work on modelling observed air pollution with machine learning and causal models.

***

This site is for writing, reference and reading.

Posts will are loosely about machine learning, causal inference (and maybe discovery...), and their applications to environmental research, particularly understanding air pollution. Other areas of environmental science of particular interest include atmospheric science more widely, (de)forestation and examining climate models.

The writing will hopefully (!) improve over time.

I may also keep a list of interesting content. This always makes me chuckle on other people's websites - why do people want to share the random things *they* think are interesting?

Actually that sounds [fun](https://shmh40.github.io/sui-generis/).
