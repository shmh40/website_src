Thursday 9th Feb. London.

Started work at 9.30am after a big sleep. Catching up on admin and loose tasks until lunchtime, before going out into the sunshine to buy lunch. Heard all about my friend's new shed at lunch - I am desperately jealous. Half-hearted attempt at reading about and then coding up some new methods after lunch. Must be more focussed. Left at 5.30pm to go out for a lovely evening. 

Wednesday 8th Feb. Cambridge.

Catch up meeting with MSci student from 8.15am to 9am to check on his progress. Reading papers and preparing for first year assessment until 10.45am. Got on the train to Cambridge from KX at 10.45am, arriving in sunny Cambridge just before noon. It's always sunny coming back to university. Saw a good friend by chance at the station, before buying a quick lunch and eating on the walk to the Department. Settled into the library to prepare for the assessment at 3.30pm. Took 20 minutes to watch Zelensky speak in Westminster Hall. Assessment from 3.30pm to 4.30pm - examiners were very kind, but defending and discussing your work for an hour with two brilliant examiners is draining. Will need a big rest after (3 hour?) PhD viva! Dropped into the office briefly before heading home.

Tuesday 7th Feb.

Supervisor meeting at 9am. Reading papers until 12pm in preparation for my first year assessment tomorrow. Quick lunch and then more reading until 4pm. Back to paper writing from 4 to 5.30pm. Brief meeting from 5.30pm to 6pm re a workshop on probabilistic methods in weather and climate that we are organising in May. Cooked supper while discussing a possible research project with my old MSci supervisor - very exciting! After supper, back to paper writing from 8.45pm to 9.45pm before sending a draft to my supervisors. Finished off the evening by organising upcoming supervisions with undergrads. 

Monday 6th Feb.

Started work at 9am. Emails and admin until 10.30am. Writing a draft of a paper until lunchtime - mostly tidying plots and improving explanations. More paper writing until 3pm, then a meeting with a prospective PhD student. At 3.30pm went for a walk to buy a present, before returning to write until 5.45pm. Out for a lovely evening!

Sunday 5th February, 2023. London.

A lovely day. Read for most of the day, then spent the afternoon and evening reviewing a paper. Early night!
