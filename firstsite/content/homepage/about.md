## Introduction

This is my site - for writing, reference and reading.

Posts will likely be about machine learning, causal inference (and maybe discovery...*eek*), and their applications to environmental research, particularly understanding air pollution. Other areas of environmental research of particular interest include atmospheric science more widely, (de)forestation and examining climate models.

Posts will hopefully (!) improve over time.

***

I may also keep a list of interesting content. This always makes me chuckle on other people's websites - why on earth do people want to share the things *they* think are interesting?

Actually that sounds fun.

## More

Posting on:

- Spatio-temporal machine learning, with traditional and graphical methods.
- Causal inference and discovery in high dimensional systems.

Wary of:

- Using too many words...
- Uncertainty
- OOD
