### A collection of good reading
<!--more-->

The [blog](https://thinkingcomplete.blogspot.com/) of **Richard Ngo**. Lovely to read about someone's answers to All Souls.

The [blogs](https://dominiccummings.com/about/) of **Dominic Cummings** are an *interesting* thing to read.

Some of **Neel Nanda**'s [blogs](https://www.neelnanda.io/) are entertaining (I am quite taken by his [*inner simulators*](https://www.neelnanda.io/blog/42-inner-sim))
