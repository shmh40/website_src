What is causal inference? Do we really need it? Is it useful in its current formulation?

## Causal inference

I shall do my best to explain causal inference. We are not going to try to unpick whether causality really exists, with a philosophical approach, we are merely going to define causality as it is commonly thought of by people - it is the act of an event leading to another event occurring. We ought to define a couple of brief conditions - firstly the cause must precede the effect temporally. Secondly, if, in an other wise identical and parallel universe the first event did not occur, then the second event would not have occurred. This condition for causality is of course impossible to test - however it gives a good intuition for what we mean by causality.

Now we need to answer why we are interested in causality. 

The key things to think about is that many current machine learning processes work brilliantly using correlation.
